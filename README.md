# refactor-style
Refactor Style is a refactor tool built in GoLang to refactor and reduce all css files in the 
given directory to minimize class duplication.

## Usage
Over the course of our work it is not uncommon to develop, inherit, or otherwise become the steward
of several CSS files for your project.  This could be organic grown CSS files over time, media query 
CSS files, or maybe you just need to add some new classes and would prefer to not end up with duplicate
definitions. One of the challenges for maintaining and improving those 
files is the ability to refactor class definition duplication across related files. This is where
refactor-style can help.

#### Refactor targets
Refactor style will condense a set of CSS files based on the follow requirements 
 1. Refactor duplicate class definitions with the same name in multiple files into a common CSS file
 2. Condense common class definitions within the same file
